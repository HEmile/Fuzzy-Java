# Fuzzy-Java
Fuzzy logic and fuzzy sets library for Java.

Contains most basic operations in the interface, and is implemented using the standard operations most common in academic literature. 


It also contains an implementation of a fuzzy rule-based system that is inspired by developments in the first-order fuzzy logic. 

This library was developed alongside writing a paper called "Fuzzy Logic Programming - A Simple Definition" for Utrecht University.
